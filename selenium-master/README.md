# Selenium

Hi ! Welcome to my Selenium Repository. I have uploaded basic selenium scripts which can be directly used by copy-pasting. To run the scripts hassle free you must have

[Selenium 2.53](http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.53) and 
[Firefox 45](http://filehippo.com/download_firefox/67317/)

Note: Firefox > v45 is not supported by Selenium 2.53
